        <h2>Jollof Rice</h2>
        <p>
            The popular jollof rice is a classic recipe that makes it to almost all special occasions in 
            Nigeria. It is a rich, tasty, and elegant meal consisting of rice cooked with pepper, broth, 
            seasoning, and spices in one pot. Serve this amazing meal with any protein of your choice.
        </p>
        <h4 class="recipe">Recipe</h4>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Rice</li>
          <li>Canned tomato, fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, scotch bonnet, onions, garlic, and ginger</li>
          <li>Vegetable oil</li>
          <li>Stock—Chicken, beef, or vegetable stock are great choices here for adding depth of flavor.</li>
          <li>seasoning and herbs—curry powder, salt, black/white pepper, bouillon powder, thyme, and bay leaves.</li>
          <li>Meat and meat stock</li>
          <li>Palm oil, seasoning cube and salt</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 class="procedure">Procedure</h4>
        <p class="stepbystep">
          <strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
          The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions. This 
          should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich 
          tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout.<br />
          <strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
          Add the ginger and garlic and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes.<br />
          <strong>Step 3:</strong><br />
          Add the blended peppers.<br />
          <strong>Step 4:</strong><br />
          Add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but optional), and seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning 
          at this point if there is a need to.<br />
          <strong>Step 5:</strong><br />
          Add the chicken stock.<br />
          <strong>Step 6:</strong><br />
          Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the rice 
          is done, about 20 to 30 minutes. Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or 
          Gizzards and plantains.<br />
